Imagine a shell, now imagine things displayed in it

Every function is included in shelldisplay.h


## Textures:

### Texture allocTexture(int width, int height)
Creates a new texture with the specified width and height.\
Texture structs can be passed by value and exist on the stack, but contain a pointer to dynamically allocated memory and must be allocated and freed

### void freeTexture(Texture t)
Frees the textures memory

### void setPixel(Texture t, int x, int y, Color c)
Sets the pixel at (_x_,_y_) to be color _c_

### Color getPixel(Texture t, int x, int y, Color c)
Returns the color of the pixel at (x,y)

### void fillTexture(Texture t, Color c)
Sets every pixel in texture _t_ to be color _c_ 

### Color sampleTexture(Texture t, double x, double y, int method);
Samples a texture at a specific point (0<=x<=1, 0<=y<=1)\
t - texture to sample\
x - x coordinate, must be in the range 0-1\
y - y coordinate, must be in the range 0-1\

method - one of the following sample methods
enum|desc
---|---
SAMPLE_NEAREST| Nearest neighbor
SAMPLE_BILINEAR| Bilinear interpolation

### Texture resampleTexture(Texture t, int width, int height, int method);
Returns a new texture with the specified size, generated by sampling from texture _t_\
The new texture must be freed at the end of its life\
The original texture is unaffected\

method - one of the following sample methods
enum|desc
---|---
SAMPLE_NEAREST| Nearest neighbor, works for up and downscaling
SAMPLE_BILINEAR| Bilinear interpolation, works for upscaling

### void printTexture(Texture t, int pixelType)
prints the given texture to stdout. The color accuracy of the printed texture will depend on the shell and the current colorMode().\
__Pixel Types__\
1 character is twice as tall as it is wide, so a square pixel's width must be double it's height\
Full block characters are used to represent spaces
enum|size|char|notes
---|---|---|---
PIX_DOUBLE_SPACE|2x1|██| Square but large
PIX_SINGLE_SPACE|1x1|█| Rectangular but allows for higher resolution. <br> Note that the texture must be wider than it is tall to remain square when printed
PIX_UPPER_HALF_BLOCK|1x0.5|▀| Small square pixels. <br> Doubles the resolution of double space but requires unicode
