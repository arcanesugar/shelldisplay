Imagine a shell, now imagine things displayed in it

Every function is included in shelldisplay.h

## Shelldisplay.c
### _Noreturn void raiseError(char* fmt, ...)
Raises an error, works like println

### void setColorMode(int mode)
Set the color mode of the library, this changes the output of setColor and related functions\
By default, CM_ANSICOLOR is the color mode\
Using an color mode incompatible with the current terminal breaks most color related functions
mode|desc
---|---
CM_ANSICOLOR| Supported by most terminals, chooses the closest color from a 256 element table (8 bit color)
CM_TRUECOLOR| Supported by modern terminals, uses full 24 bit color

### void setStyle(int style);
Sets the style of text, everything printed after using this function will be using the specified style\
Style can be changed in the middle of sentinces to mix different styles\
Styles can be combined with bitwises or (eg S_BOLD|S_ITALIC)\
enum|ex
---|---
S_BOLD| __Text__
S_DIM| -
S_ITALIC | _Text_
S_UNDERLINE | <ins>Text</ins>
S_BLINK| -
S_INVERSE| -
S_HIDDEN| -
S_STRIKETHROUGH| ~~Text~~

### void setColor(bool background, Color color)
Sets the color of all text printed after the function call
If background is true, sets the background color instead

### void resetColor()
Resets foreground and background colors to default

### void clearScreen()
Clears the terminal

## Color invertColor(Color c)
Returns 1-_c_

## Color lerpColors(Color a, Color b, double x)
Linearly interpolates between _a_ and _b_

## Color multiplyColors(Color a, Color b)
Returns _a_ and _b_ muliplied component-wise

### bool compareColors(Color a, Color b);
Returns true if _a_ == _b_

## Texture.c:

### Texture allocTexture(int width, int height)
Creates a new texture with the specified width and height.\
Texture structs can be passed by value and exist on the stack, but contain a pointer to dynamically allocated memory and must be allocated and freed

### void freeTexture(Texture t)
Frees the textures memory

### void setPixel(Texture t, int x, int y, Color c)
Sets the pixel at (_x_,_y_) to be color _c_

### Color getPixel(Texture t, int x, int y, Color c)
Returns the color of the pixel at (x,y)

### void fillTexture(Texture t, Color c)
Sets every pixel in texture _t_ to be color _c_ 

### Color sampleTexture(Texture t, double x, double y, int method);
Samples a texture at a specific point (0<=x<=1, 0<=y<=1)\
t - texture to sample\
x - x coordinate, must be in the range 0-1\
y - y coordinate, must be in the range 0-1\
```

  |          |
  |          |
(0,1)------(1,1)
```
method - one of the following sample methods
enum|desc
---|---
SAMPLE_NEAREST| Nearest neighbor
SAMPLE_BILINEAR| Bilinear interpolation

### Texture resampleTexture(Texture t, int width, int height, int method);
Returns a new texture with the specified size, generated by sampling from texture _t_\
The new texture must be freed at the end of its life\
The original texture is unaffected\

method - one of the following sample methods
enum|desc
---|---
SAMPLE_NEAREST| Nearest neighbor, works for up and downscaling
SAMPLE_BILINEAR| Bilinear interpolation, works for upscaling

### void printTexture(Texture t, int pixelType)
prints the given texture to stdout. The color accuracy of the printed texture will depend on the shell and the current colorMode().\
__Pixel Types__\
1 character is twice as tall as it is wide, so a square pixel's width must be double it's height\
Full block characters are used to represent spaces
enum|size|char|notes
---|---|---|---
PIX_DOUBLE_SPACE|2x1|██| Square but large
PIX_SINGLE_SPACE|1x1|█| Rectangular but allows for higher resolution. <br> Note that the texture must be wider than it is tall to remain square when printed
PIX_UPPER_HALF_BLOCK|1x0.5|▀| Small square pixels. <br> Doubles the resolution of double space but requires unicode
